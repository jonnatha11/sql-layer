A Cursor is used to scan a sequence of rows resulting from the execution of an operator.
The same cursor may be used for multiple executions of the operator, possibly with different bindings.

A Cursor is always in one of four states:

- CLOSED: The cursor is not currently involved in a scan. Invocations of next() on 
        the cursor will raise an exception. The cursor is in this state when one of
        the following is true:
        - open() has never been called.
        - The most recent method invocation was to close().

- ACTIVE: The cursor is currently involved in a scan. The cursor is in this state when one
      of the following is true:
      - The most recent method invocation was to open().
      - The most recent method invocation was to next(), which returned a non-null value.

- IDLE: The cursor is currently involved in a scan. The cursor is in this state when one
      of the following is true:
      - The most recent method invocation was to next(), which returned null.

The Cursor lifecycle is as follows:

                close                  
        +-------------------+          
        |                   |          
        v       open        +          
        CLOSED +-----> ACTIVE <-------+
        ^                   +         |
        |close      next    | next    |
        |           == null | != null |
        +-+ IDLE <----------v---------+
