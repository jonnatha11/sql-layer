## Tests the LAST_DAY function
---
- Include: all-types-schema.yaml
---
- Statement: INSERT INTO all_types(bigint_field, varchar_field, date_field, datetime_field, double_field)
                VALUES (20090101, '2008-02-01', '1900-02-01', '2000-02-01 23:59:59', 19940131.5);
## Test with literals
---
- Statement: SELECT LAST_DAY('2009-12-12') FROM all_types;
- output: [['2009-12-31']]
---
- Statement: SELECT LAST_DAY(20091231) FROM all_types;
- output: [['2009-12-31']]
---
- Statement: SELECT LAST_DAY(20070132) FROM all_types;
- output: [[null]]
---
- Statement: SELECT LAST_DAY(20000225) FROM all_types;
- output: [['2000-02-29']]
---
- Statement: SELECT LAST_DAY(DATE('1994-04-01')) from all_types;
- output: [['1994-04-30']]
---
- Statement: SELECT LAST_DAY(DATE('1994-00-01')) from all_types;
- output: [[null]]
---
- Statement: SELECT LAST_DAY(null) from all_types;
- output: [[null]]
---
- Statement: SELECT bigint_field from all_types WHERE LAST_DAY('1900-04-30 23:59:59') = DATE('1900-04-30');
- output: [[20090101]]
## Test with params
---
- Statement: SELECT LAST_DAY(?) from all_types;
- params: [['1991-04-30']]
- output: [['1991-04-30']]
## test with fields
--- # LAST_DAY(19949131.5) gets rounded to 1994-02-32 => invalid date => null
- Statement: SELECT LAST_DAY(double_field) from all_types;
- output: [[null]]
---
- Statement: SELECT LAST_DAY(varchar_field) from all_types;
- output: [['2008-02-29']]
